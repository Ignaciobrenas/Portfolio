Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Ignacio Breñas Muñoz, a junior IT technician specialized in computer systems and networks, with hands-on experience in technical support, hardware maintenance, and basic web development. I recently completed a Vocational Training Program in Microcomputer Systems and Networks, and in September 2025 I will begin a Higher Degree in Web Application Development (DAW).

This portfolio showcases my practical work, including PC assembly and repair, network setup, operating system installation, WordPress website design, and basic programming projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It reflects my passion for technology, my problem-solving mindset, and my commitment to continuous learning.
